--PULL strategy -> connecting to relational databases/any system to pull the data.
                   This might cause issues as it might overload the systems. i.e., if we are using sqoop to load data from a OLTP database, it might overload the OLTP database.
--PUSH strategy -> It will be source systems responsibility to provide the data. generally source systems will push the data into staging                 file servers and from there we will load into hadoop
--SQOOP is generally used for PULL strategy and MR, HIVE , SPARK .. can be used for PUSH strategy
--Mainframes uses IBM NDM to push the data into staging servers/locations

-- filter the data as much as possible and as early as possible
--HIVE is used to load data from flat files into HDFS, MR can extend the capabilities of load process
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQOOP 
    -- data load tool, both in(import) and out of(export) hadoop
    -- written in Java and open source
    -- Uses JDBC for DB connectivity
    -- Uses Map Reduce framework
    -- sqoop follows map only architecture, so no reduce tasks in import & export
    -- sqoop is bunch of jar files which does the required tasks
    -- it is not that secure
    -- only 3 components in sqoop architecture - source systems, hadoop and sqoop 
    -- only command line interface
    -- Map task connects to both DBs and hadoop
    
SQOOP2
    --It uses Client/Server architecture
    --It uses both map and reduce
    --avaiable on web and command line
    --it is highly secure
    --Admins setup the connectors to the database and developers use the connector ids to connect
    --Sqoop client(web browser/command line) will connect to the SQOOP Server(this supports REST/UI and has the connectors and metadata) and SQOOP Server is connected to Metadata repository , HDFS/HIVE/HBASE(through reduce task) and DBs(through map task).
